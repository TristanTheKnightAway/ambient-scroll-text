            Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken. The bear and the maiden fair. Hear me roar! The bear and the maiden fair.
            All men must die. The bear and the maiden fair. The tourney of Ashford Meadows.
            When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken. Pay the iron price.

            House Tarly of Horn Hill The tourney of Ashford Meadows. Bastards are born of passion, aren't they?
            We don't despise them in Dorne. A dance of dragons. Dunc the Lunk, thick as a castle wall.
            Winter is coming. Can a man still be brave if he’s afraid? That is the only time a man can be brave.
